## Requirements

- **Windows 11 26100 or newer**
- **Administrator privileges** - Script must be run as administrator (elevated)

## Basic Usage

```powershell
.\dev_drive.ps1
```
This script runs in interactive mode and will guide you through the entire Dev Drive creation process.

**Important**: The script performs disk operations and must be run with administrator privileges. Right-click the script and select "Run as administrator" or use an elevated PowerShell session.

### What the Interactive Process Includes:

Getting Partition information...
Shrinkable size information:
  Current partition size: 3613.28 GB                                                                         
  Minimum partition size: 2796.92 GB                                                                         
  Maximum shrinkable: 816.36 GB                                                                              
                                                                                                             
Note: Windows allows shrinking by the size of starting from the end of the drive disk space to the nearest written file block. Disk Fragmentation can affect this. If Windows does not allow for a drive to be shrunk, please use third-party tools (e.g. AOMEI).                                                                      
                                                                                                             
Enter amount to shrink in GB (max: 816.36 GB): 199                                                           
                                                                                                             
Do you want to enable BitLocker encryption for the Dev Drive?                                                
BitLocker provides security but may impact performance.
1. Yes, enable BitLocker encryption
2. No, skip BitLocker encryption

Enter your choice (1 or 2): 2

Do you want to enable ReFS deduplication for the Dev Drive?                                                  
Deduplication saves disk space by eliminating duplicate data.
1. Yes, enable deduplication only (recommended for most users)
2. Yes, enable deduplication + compression (configure compression settings)
3. No, skip deduplication (maximum performance, less space savings)

Enter your choice (1, 2 or 3): 2

Choose compression format:                                                                                   
1. LZ4: Fast compression with good balance of speed and compression ratio
2. ZSTD: Better compression ratio but uses more CPU (allows custom compression level)

Enter your choice (1 or 2): 2

Choose ZSTD compression level (1-9):                                                                         
Lower levels (1-3): Faster compression, less CPU usage
Medium levels (4-6): Balanced speed and compression
Higher levels (7-9): Better compression, more CPU usage

Enter compression level (1-9): 2
Selected ZSTD compression with level 2

## What It Does

### Interactive Dev Drive Creation Process:

1. **Drive Discovery & Selection**
   - Scans all physical drives and shows size, free space, and existing partitions
   - User selects target physical drive for Dev Drive creation
   - Displays real Windows partition limits (not estimates)

2. **Creation Method Selection**
   - **Free Space Mode**: Uses unallocated space on the selected drive
   - **Shrink Mode**: Shrinks an existing logical drive to create space
   - Shows available options based on selected drive

3. **Size Configuration**
   - Prompts for Dev Drive size with real limits shown
   - Press Enter to use maximum available space
   - Validates input against actual Windows constraints

4. **Security Configuration**
   - Optional BitLocker encryption with strong password requirements
   - Automatic retry if password is rejected by BitLocker
   - Azure AD backup for recovery keys

5. **Storage Optimization Setup**
   - Choose deduplication level (none, deduplication-only, or with compression)
   - Select compression format (LZ4 for speed, ZSTD for better compression)
   - Configure compression level (1-9 for ZSTD, affects CPU usage)
   - Jobs automatically scheduled to run only on AC power

6. **Dev Drive Creation & Setup**
   - Creates ReFS-formatted Dev Drive with selected size
   - Applies all chosen security and optimization settings
   - Marks drive as trusted for Windows Defender performance
   - Runs initial optimization job to prepare the drive

### Advanced Features:

- **Real-Time Validation**: Shows actual Windows limits, not estimates
- **Smart Defaults**: Sensible defaults with easy override options
- **Power Management**: Deduplication jobs only run on AC power
- **Error Recovery**: Handles password rejection and API failures gracefully
- **User-Friendly**: Clear prompts with helpful explanations throughout

## Security Notes

- Requires complex password (8+ chars, upper/lower/digit/special)
- BitLocker recovery key backed up to Azure AD
- Auto-unlock enabled for convenience
- Drive marked as trusted for development workloads

## Scheduled Jobs

The script creates two daily deduplication jobs that run **only on AC power**:
- 11:00 AM (2 hours duration)
- 5:00 PM (2 hours duration)

Jobs run Monday-Friday with 60% CPU limit to preserve battery life on laptops.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure sufficient free space exists on the selected physical disk
- Run as Administrator
- Verify Azure AD connectivity for BitLocker backup
- Check Dev Drive support on your Windows version
